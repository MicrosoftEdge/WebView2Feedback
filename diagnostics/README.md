# Gathering Diagnostics and Logs
This folder provides step-by-step instructions for collecting detailed diagnostics and logs to help troubleshoot WebView2-related issues. Before opening a new issue, please review the table below and gather the most relevant diagnostic logs for your scenario. Supplying the appropriate logs greatly improves the chances of a quick and accurate resolution.

| Tool / Log                | Purpose                                                                 | Use Case                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Crash Dumps](crash.md)               | Capture crash data for WebView2 processes.                              | Used when a child process crashes (via ProcessFailed event) or browser process fails. |
| [ETW Trace](etw.md)                 | Event Tracing for Windows logs detailed system and WebView2 activity.   | **Preferred log for most WebView2 issues.** Used to analyze system state and WebView2 behavior before/during issues. |
| [Memory Dumps (Task Manager)](task_manager_dump.md)| Manual memory capture for unresponsive processes.                      | Helpful when WebView2 hangs or becomes non-responsive.                   |
| [Installer Logs](install.md)            | Logs errors encountered during WebView2 runtime installation or updates.| Diagnose installation failures or update issues.                         |
| [GPU Info](gpu.md)                  | Provides details about  the GPU and rendering pipeline.                  | Useful for troubleshooting graphics-related problems.                    |
| [Network Logs](network.md)              | Records network requests, responses, and errors.                        | Diagnose issues with loading resources or connectivity failures.         |
| [Code Integrity](code_integrity.md)            | Identifies root causes of `STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_HASH` errors.           | Used when encountering image hash validation failures.                   |
| [Test in Canary](test_canary.md)            | Allows testing of WebView2 runtime changes using Edge Canary builds.    | Preview and validate fixes or features before stable release.            |
| [Procmon (Process Monitor)](procmon.md) | Captures detailed file system, registry, and process activity.           | Useful for diagnosing issues such as missing files, access denied errors, or interference from other processes.                    |
| [Time Travel Debugging (TTD)](ttd.md)  | Captures detailed call stacks and execution sequences.                                        | Ideal for deep debugging when other logs are insufficient.                 |
