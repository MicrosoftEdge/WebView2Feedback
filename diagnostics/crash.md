# Crash Dumps
Crash dumps are used to better understand why a WV2 process is crashing and firing a [ProcessFailed](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.web.webview2.core.corewebview2.processfailed) event. If you're experiencing crashes, the information included in the [ProcessFailed event arguments](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.web.webview2.core.corewebview2processfailedeventargs) is a good starting point:
- ExitCode
- ProcessDescription
- ProcessFailedKind
- Reason

In addition to that, crash dumps are extremely helpful. WV2 crash dumps are located in a subfolder of the app's user data folder (UDF): `<UDF>\EBWebView\Crashpad\reports\`.
By default the user data folder is created in the app's folder by default with a name like
`<App Exe Name>.exe.WebView2`. If an app sets its user data folder location manually when creating a [WV2 Environment object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.web.webview2.core.corewebview2environment), it may be in a different location.
