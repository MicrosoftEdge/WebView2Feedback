# Code Integrity in WebView2

## Why it is important
Code integrity is a feature of Windows that verifies the authenticity and integrity of the code that runs on your system. It helps protect your system from malware, tampering, and unauthorized changes. Code integrity checks the digital signatures of the files that are loaded into memory, and prevents any file that does not have a valid signature from running in webview2.

## Symptoms
Child process failed with kind COREWEBVIEW2_PROCESS_FAILED_KIND_RENDER_PROCESS_EXITED
and exit code -1073740760 or STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_HASH.

Users may see error page in the WebView2:
