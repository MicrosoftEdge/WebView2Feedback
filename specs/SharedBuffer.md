Shared Buffer Between Native Application Code and Script
===

# Background
For some advanced scenarios, there is a need to exchange large amounts of data
between the WebView2 application process and trusted web pages that are considered
as part of the app. Some examples:
- Web page generates a large amount of data, and passes it to the native side to be
  further processed or fed to other parts of the app or OS. For example, the web page
  generates 100MBs of high DPI images to be printed and needs to pass that to the native
  code to print. See https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/89.
- Native side generates a large amount of data for the web side to consume. The data
  might or might not come directly from files. For example the native side has generated
  terabytes of data to produce different graphs on the web side.
  See https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/1005.

To support these scenarios, we are adding an Edge WebView2 API to support sharing
buffers between the WebView2 host app process and WebView2 renderer process, based
on shared memory from the OS.

The application code can use the APIs to create a shared buffer object, and share to
scripts as [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) object.
Then both the native application code and the script will be able to access the same memory.

# Conceptual pages (How To)

Besides using the memory address directly, the shared buffer object can be accessed
from native side via an IStream* object that you can get from the shared buffer object.

When the application code calls `PostSharedBufferToScript`, the script side will
receive a `sharedbufferreceived` event that you can get from it the buffer as an `ArrayBuffer` object.
After getting the shared buffer, it can access it the same way as any other
ArrayBuffer object, including transferring to a web worker to process the data on
the worker thread.

As shared buffer normally represent a large memory, instead of waiting for garbage
collection to release the memory along with the owning objects, the application
should try to release the buffer as soon as it doesn't need access to it.
This can be done by calling Close() method on the shared buffer object, or
`chrome.webview.releaseBuffer` from script.

As the memory could contain sensitive information and corrupted memory could crash
the application, the application should only share buffer with trusted sites.

The application can use other messaging channel like `PostWebMessageAsJson` and
`chrome.webview.postMessage` to inform the other side the desire to have a shared
buffer and the status of the buffer (like data is produced or consumed).

# Examples

The example below illustrates how to send data from application to script for one time read only consumption.

The script code will look like this:
```
        window.onload = function () {
            window.chrome.webview.addEventListener("sharedbufferreceived", e => {
                SharedBufferReceived(e);
            });
        }

        function SharedBufferReceived(e) {
            if (e.additionalData && e.additionalData.contosoBufferKind == "contosoDisplayBuffer") {
                let displayBuffer = e.getBuffer();
                // Consume the data from the buffer (in the form of an ArrayBuffer)
                let displayBufferArray = new Uint8Array(displayBuffer);
                DisplaySharedBufferData(displayBufferArray);
                // Release the buffer after consuming the data.
                chrome.webview.releaseBuffer(displayBuffer);
            }
        }
```
## Win32 C++
```cpp

        wil::com_ptr<ICoreWebView2SharedBuffer> sharedBuffer;
        CHECK_FAILURE(m_webviewEnvironment->CreateSharedBuffer(dataSize, &sharedBuffer));
        BYTE* buffer;
        CHECK_FAILURE(sharedBuffer->get_Buffer(&buffer));
        // Fill buffer with data.
        memcpy_s(buffer, dataSize, data, dataSize);
        PCWSTR additionalDataAsJson = L"{\"contosoBufferKind\":\"contosoDisplayBuffer\"}";
        m_webView->PostSharedBufferToScript(
           sharedBuffer.get(), COREWEBVIEW2_SHARED_BUFFER_ACCESS_READ_ONLY, additionalDataAsJson);

        // The buffer automatically releases any resources if all references to it are released.
        // As we are doing here, you could also explicitly close it when you don't access the buffer
        // any more.to ensure that the resource is released timely even if there are some reference got leaked.
        sharedBuffer->Close();
        
```
## .NET
```c#
      using (CoreWebView2SharedBuffer sharedBuffer = WebViewEnvironment.CreateSharedBuffer(dataSize))
      {
          // Fill buffer with data.
          unsafe
          {
              byte* buffer = (byte*)(sharedBuffer.Buffer.ToPointer());
              ulong dataToCopy = dataSize;
              while (dataToCopy-- > 0) {
                  *buffer++ = *data++;
              }
         }
          string additionalDataAsJson = "{\"contosoBufferKind\":\"contosoDisplayBuffer\"}";
           m_webview.PostSharedBufferToScript(sharedBuffer, CoreWebView2SharedBufferAccess.ReadOnly, additionalDataAsJson);
      }
```
## WinRT
```c#
      using (CoreWebView2SharedBuffer sharedBuffer = WebViewEnvironment.CreateSharedBuffer(dataSize))
      {
          // Fill buffer with data.
          unsafe
          {
              using (IMemoryBufferReference reference = sharedBuffer.Buffer)
              {
                  byte* buffer;
                  uint capacity;
                  ((IMemoryBufferByteAccess)reference).GetBuffer(out buffer, out capacity);
                  byte* buffer = (byte*)(sharedBuffer.Buffer.ToPointer());
                  ulong dataToCopy = dataSize;
                  while (dataToCopy-- > 0) {
                      *buffer++ = *data++;
                  }
              }
         }
          string additionalDataAsJson = "{\"contosoBufferKind\":\"contosoDisplayBuffer\"}";
           m_webview.PostSharedBufferToScript(sharedBuffer, CoreWebView2SharedBufferAccess.ReadOnly, additionalDataAsJson);
      }
```

The example below illustrates how to use a shared buffer to send data from application to script in an iframe multiple times.

The script code will look like this:
```
        let displayBuffer;
        let displayBufferArray;
        window.onload = function () {
            window.chrome.webview.addEventListener("sharedbufferreceived", e => {
                if (e.additionalData && e.additionalData.contosoBufferKind == "contosoDisplayBuffer") {
                    // Release potential previous buffer to ensure that the underlying resource can be released timely.
                    if (displayBuffer)
                        chrome.webview.releaseBuffer(displayBuffer);
                    // Hold the shared buffer and the typed array view of it.
                    displayBuffer = e.getBuffer();
                    displayBufferArray = new Uint8Array(displayBuffer);
                }
            });
            window.chrome.webview.addEventListener("message", e => {
                if (e.data == "DisplayBufferUpdated") {
                    // Consume the updated data
                    DisplaySharedBufferData(displayBufferArray);
                    // Notify the application that the data has been consumed
                    window.chrome.webview.postMessage("DisplayBufferConsumed");
                } else if (e.data = "ReleaseDisplayBuffer") {
                    // Release the buffer, don't need it anymore.
                    chrome.webview.releaseBuffer(displayBuffer);
                    // Clear variables holding the buffer.
                    displayBuffer = undefined;
                    displayBufferArray = undefined;
                }
            });
        }
