# Background
The WebView2 team has been asked for an API to get the response for a web
resource as it was received and to provide request headers not available when
`WebResourceRequested` event is raised (such as HTTP Authentication headers).
The `WebResourceResponseReceived` event provides such response representation
and exposes the request as committed. A web request is any URI resolution the
WebView performs. This includes declarative `<img src="...">` from HTML,
implicit `favicon.ico` lookups, and JavaScript in the document calling the
`fetch(...)` API.

In this document we describe the new API. We'd appreciate your feedback.

# Description
The `WebResourceResponseReceived` event allows developers to inspect the
response object from URL requests (such as HTTP/HTTPS, file and data). A key
scenario is to allow developers to get Auth headers from an HTTP response to
authenticate other tools they're using, since the Auth headers are not exposed
in the `WebResourceRequested` event.

This event is raised when the WebView receives the response for a request for a
web resource. It provides access to both the response as it was received and the
request as it was committed, including modifications made by the network stack
(such as the adding of HTTP Authorization headers). The app can use this event
to view the actual request and response for a web resource. Modifications to the
request object are set but have no effect on WebView processing it. There is no
ordering guarantee between WebView processing the response and the host app's
event handler running.

When the event is raised, the WebView will pass a
`WebResourceResponseReceivedEventArgs`, which lets the app view the request and
response. To get the response content, call `TryGetContent` on the
`CoreWebView2WebResourceResponseView` object from the event args.

# Examples
The following code snippets demonstrate how the `WebResourceResponseReceived`
event can be used:

## COM
```cpp
EventRegistrationToken m_webResourceResponseReceivedToken = {};

m_webview->add_WebResourceResponseReceived(
    Callback<ICoreWebView2WebResourceResponseReceivedEventHandler>(
        [this](ICoreWebView2* webview, ICoreWebView2WebResourceResponseReceivedEventArgs* args)
            -> HRESULT {
            // The request object as committed
            wil::com_ptr<ICoreWebView2WebResourceRequest> webResourceRequest;
            CHECK_FAILURE(args->get_Request(&webResourceRequest));
            // The response object as received
            wil::com_ptr<ICoreWebView2WebResourceResponseView> webResourceResponse;
            CHECK_FAILURE(args->get_Response(&webResourceResponse));
            
            // Get body content for the response. Redirect responses will
            // return an error HRESULT as their body (if any) is ignored.
            HRESULT getContentCallResult = webResourceResponse->TryGetContent(
                Callback<
                    ICoreWebView2WebResourceResponseViewTryGetContentCompletedHandler>(
                    [this, webResourceRequest, webResourceResponse](HRESULT result, IStream* content) {
                        // The response might not have content, or it might have failed loading.
                        bool gotContent = SUCCEEDED(result);
                        
                        std::wstring message =
                            L"{ \"kind\": \"event\", \"name\": "
                            L"\"WebResourceResponseReceived\", \"args\": {"
                            L"\"request\": " +
                            RequestToJsonString(webResourceRequest.get()) +
                            L", "
                            L"\"response\": " +
                            ResponseToJsonString(webResourceResponse.get(), content) + L"}";

                        message +=
                            WebViewPropertiesToJsonString(m_webview.get());
                        message += L"}";
                        PostEventMessage(message);
                        return S_OK;
                    })
                    .Get());

            return S_OK;
        })
        .Get(),
    &m_webResourceResponseReceivedToken);
```

## C#
```c#
WebView.WebResourceResponseReceived += WebView_WebResourceResponseReceived;

// Note: modifications made to request are set but have no effect on WebView processing it.
private async void WebView_WebResourceResponseReceived(CoreWebView2 sender, CoreWebView2WebResourceResponseReceivedEventArgs e)
{
    // Actual headers sent with request
    foreach (var current in e.Request.Headers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(current);
    }

    // Headers in response received
    foreach (var current in e.Response.Headers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(current);
    }

    // Status code from response received
    int status = e.Response.StatusCode;
    if (status == 200)
    {
        // Handle
        Console.WriteLine("Request succeeded!");

        // Get response body
        try
        {
            System.IO.Stream content = await e.Response.TryGetContentAsync();
            DoSomethingWithResponseContent(content);
        }
        catch (COMException ex)
        {
            // A COMException will be thrown if no content was found for the
            // response, or if it failed to load.
        }
    }
}
```


# Remarks
Calling `ICoreWebView2WebResourceResponseView::TryGetContent` will return an
error HRESULT for redirect responses, as their content (if any) is ignored.
`ICoreWebView2WebResourceResponseViewTryGetContentCompletedHandler` will be
invoked with a failure errorCode if no content was found for the response, or if
the content failed to load.
Calling `CoreWebView2WebResourceResponseView.TryGetContentAsync` will throw a
`COMException` if the response has no body. As noted, the body for redirect
responses is ignored.
