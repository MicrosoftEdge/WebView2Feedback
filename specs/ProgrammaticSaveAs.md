Programmatic Save As API
===

# Background

Chromium browser's context menus have a "Save as" menu item to save the document
(html page, image, pdf, or other content) through a save as dialog. We provide
more flexible ways to programmatically perform the Save As operation in WebView2.

With the new API you will be able to:
- Launch the default save as dialog
- Block the default save as dialog
- Request save as silently by providing the path and save as kind
- Build your own save as UI

The chromium browser's Save As operation consists of showing the Save As dialog 
and then starting a download of the document. The Save As method and event
described in this document relate to the Save As dialog and not the download,
which will go through the existing WebView2 download APIs. 

We'd appreciate your feedback.

# Description

We propose the `CoreWebView2.ShowSaveAsUI` method, which allows you to trigger 
the Save As UX programmatically. By using this method, the system default dialog, 
or your own UI will show and start the Save As operation.

We also propose the `CoreWebView2.SaveAsUIShowing` event. You can register this event to block 
the default dialog and instead create your own Save As UI using the `SaveAsUIShowingEventArgs`, 
to set your preferred save as path, save as kind, and duplicate file replacement rule. 
In your client app, you can design your own UI to input these parameters. 
For HTML documents, we support 3 save as kinds: HTML_ONLY, SINGLE_FILE and 
COMPLETE. Non-HTML documents, you must use DEFAULT, which will save the content as 
it is. This API has default values for all parameters, to perform the common 
save as operation.

# Examples
## Win32 C++ 
### Programmatic Save As
This example hides the default save as dialog and shows a customized dialog.
The sample code will register a handler and trigger programmaic save as once.
```c++
bool ScenarioSaveAs::ProgrammaticSaveAs()
{
    if (!m_webView2_24)
        return false;

    // Register a handler for the `SaveAsUIShowing` event.
    m_webView2_24->add_SaveAsUIShowing(
        Callback<ICoreWebView2SaveAsUIShowingEventHandler>(
            [this](
            ICoreWebView2* sender,
                ICoreWebView2SaveAsUIShowingEventArgs* args) -> HRESULT
            {
                // Hide the system default save as dialog.
                CHECK_FAILURE(args->put_SuppressDefaultDialog(TRUE));
                
                auto showCustomizedDialog = [this, args = wil:: make_com_ptr(args)]
                {
                    // As an end developer, you can design your own dialog UI, or no UI at all.
                    // You can ask the user to provide information like file name, file extension, 
                    // and so on. Finally, and set them on the event args.
                    //
                    // This is a customized dialog example, the constructor returns after the 
                    // dialog interaction is completed by the end user.
                    SaveAsDialog dialog;
                    if (dialog.confirmed)
                    {
                        // Setting the SaveAsFilePath, Kind, AllowReplace for the event
                        // args from this customized dialog inputs is optional. The event 
                        // args has default values based on the document to save.
                        //
                        // Additionally, you can use `get_ContentMimeType` to check the mime 
                        // type of the document that will be saved to help the Kind selection.
                        CHECK_FAILURE(
                            args->put_SaveAsFilePath((LPCWSTR)dialog.path.c_str()));
                        CHECK_FAILURE(args->put_Kind(dialog.selectedKind));
                        CHECK_FAILURE(args->put_AllowReplace(dialog.allowReplace));
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        // Save As cancelled from this customized dialog.
                        CHECK_FAILURE(args->put_Cancel(TRUE));
                    }
                };

                wil::com_ptr<ICoreWebView2Deferral> deferral;
                CHECK_FAILURE(args->GetDeferral(&deferral));

                m_appWindow->RunAsync(
                    [deferral, showCustomizedDialog]()
                    {
                        showCustomizedDialog();
                        CHECK_FAILURE(deferral->Complete());
                    });
                return S_OK;
            })
            .Get(),
        &m_SaveAsUIShowingToken);
        
    // Call method ShowSaveAsUI to trigger the programmatic save as once.
    m_webView2_24->ShowSaveAsUI(
        Callback<ICoreWebView2ShowSaveAsUICompletedHandler>(
            [this](HRESULT errorCode, COREWEBVIEW2_SAVE_AS_UI_RESULT result) -> HRESULT
            {

                MessageBox(
                    m_appWindow->GetMainWindow(),
                    (L"Save As " + saveAsUIString[result]).c_str(), L"Info", MB_OK);
                return S_OK;
            })

    return true;
