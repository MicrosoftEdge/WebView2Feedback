# Background
In the `NavigationCompleted` event, the `WebErrorStatus` property provides information about why a
navigation may have failed.  However, this is more geared toward network failures, and doesn't
provide a comprehensive mapping of HTTP status codes.  And even if it did provide an enum value
for every common HTTP status code, it is still possible for a server to respond with a custom
status code, which an application might want to recognize and handle.

The `WebResourceResponseReceived` event does provide information about the response, including
its HTTP status, but it is difficult to correlate a `WebResourceResponse` with a given navigation.

There are various ways the API could be improved to provide this information, but for now we are
going with the simplest approach, and adding a new property that provides an HTTP status code in
the NavigationCompleted event.

# Description
The `NavigationCompletedEventArgs` interface will be given a new property, `HttpStatusCode`, which
has the HTTP status code of the navigation if it involved an HTTP request.  For instance, this will
usually be 200 if the request was successful, 404 if a page was not found, etc.  See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status for a list of common status codes.

The `HttpStatusCode` property will be 0 in the following cases:
* The navigation did not involve an HTTP request.  For instance, if it was a navigation to a
  file:// URL, or if it was a same-document navigation.
* The navigation failed before a response was received.  For instance, if the hostname was not
  found, or if there was a network error.

In those cases, you can get more information from the `IsSuccess` and `WebErrorStatus` properties.

If the navigation receives a successful HTTP response, but the navigated page calls
`window.stop()` before it finishes loading, then `HttpStatusCode` may contain a success code like
200, but `IsSuccess` will be false and `WebErrorStatus` will be `ConnectionAborted`.

Since WebView2 handles HTTP continuations and redirects automatically, it is unlikely for
`HttpStatusCode` to ever be in the 1xx or 3xx ranges.

# Examples
## Win32 C++
```c++
void NavigationCompletedSample()
{
    m_webview->add_NavigationCompleted(
        Callback<ICoreWebView2NavigationCompletedEventHandler>(
            [this](
                ICoreWebView2* sender,
                ICoreWebView2NavigationCompletedEventArgs* args)
            {
                wil::com_ptr<ICoreWebView2NavigationCompletedEventArgs2> args2;
                args->QueryInterface(IID_PPV_ARGS(&args2));
                if (args2)
                {
                    int status_code;
                    args2->get_HttpStatusCode(&status_code);
                    if (status_code == 403)
                    {
                        ReportForbidden();
                    }
                    else if (status_code == 404)
                    {
                        ReportNotFound();
                    }
                    else if (status_code >= 500 && status_code <= 599)
                    {
                        ReportServerError(status_code);
                    }
                }
                return S_OK;
            }).Get(), nullptr);
}
```

## .NET C#
```c#
void NavigationCompletedSample()
{
    _webview.NavigationCompleted += (object sender, CoreWebView2NavigationCompletedEventArgs args) =>
    {
        int statusCode = args.HttpStatusCode;
        if (status_code == 403)
        {
            ReportForbidden();
        }
        else if (status_code == 404)
        {
            ReportNotFound();
        }
        else if (status_code >= 500 && status_code <= 599)
        {
            ReportServerError(status_code);
        }
    };
}
```
