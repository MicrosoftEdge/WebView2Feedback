# Background
The WebView attempts to detects monitor scale changes and applies the monitor DPI scale to all UI produced by the WebView.
When the host app has a DPI awareness of PerMonitorV2, then all child HWNDs receive WM_DPICHANGED.
The WebView can check the current monitor DPI scale when it receives WM_DPICHANGED.
But if the host app is just PerMonitor aware (not v2), then only the top level window receives WM_DPICHANGED.
The WebView could try to use other metrics (like resize) to check the DPI, but resize is not guaranteed in that scenario.
From [GitHub feedback](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/65),
we also know that there are consumers of WebView that want to explicitly set a custom DPI scale for WebView.

In this document we describe the updated API. We'd appreciate your feedback.


# Description
To allow the app to control the DPI scale of WebView, we are adding a `RasterizationScale` property to the CoreWebView2Controller interface.
The RasterizationScale property controls the DPI scaling for all UI in WebView.

In order to maintain compatibility with apps developed before this API existed,
WebView2 continues to detect monitor scale changes by default and will update the RasterizationScale property.
When the RasterizationScale property is updated, the `RasterizationScaleChanged` event is raised.
The app can tell WebView2 to stop updating the RasterizationScale property by changing
`ShouldDetectMonitorDpiScaleChanges` from the default value of true, to false.

# Examples
The following code snippets show how to use the RasterizationScale and ShouldDetectMonitorScaleChanges properties,
and now to listen to the RasterizationScaleChanged event.
## Win32 C++
```cpp
void ViewComponent::SetRasterizationScale(float additionalScale)
{
    CHECK_FAILURE(m_controller->put_ShouldDetectMonitorScaleChanges(FALSE));
    m_webviewAdditionalRasterizationScale = additionalScale;
    // RasterizationScale is typically the monitor DPI scale and text scaling, but
    // the app could add an additional scale for its own scenarios.
    double rasterizationScale =
        additionalScale * m_appWindow->GetDpiScale() * m_appWindow->GetTextScale();
    CHECK_FAILURE(m_controller->put_RasterizationScale(rasterizationScale));
}

Callback<ICoreWebView2RasterizationScaleChangedEventHandler>(
    [this](ICoreWebView2Controller* sender, IUnknown* args) -> HRESULT {
        double rasterizationScale;
        CHECK_FAILURE(m_controller->get_RasterizationScale(&rasterizationScale));

        std::wstring message = L"WebView2APISample (RasterizationScale: " +
            std::to_wstring(int(rasterizationScale * 100)) + L"%)";
        SetWindowText(m_appWindow->GetMainWindow(), message.c_str());
        return S_OK;
    })
.Get(), &m_rasterizationScaleChangedToken));
```
## .Net
```c#
public void SetRasterizationScale(double additionalScale)
{
    CoreWebView2Controller.ShouldDetectMonitorScaleChanges = false;
    m_webviewAdditionalRasterizationScale = additionalScale;
    
    // RasterizationScale is typically the monitor DPI scale and text scaling, but
    // the app could add an additional scale for its own scenarios.
    double rasterizationScale = additionalScale * GetDpiScale() * GetTextScale();
    CoreWebView2Controller.RasterizationScale = rasterizationScale;
}
```
