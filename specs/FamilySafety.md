Family Safety
===

# Background
Our customers have asked for a new API to toggle the Family Safety feature on and off. The Family 
Safety feature is enabled or disabled for a browser process instance, and the end developer 
won't be able to change it while the webview2 browser process instance is running. Once enabled, 
it will provide the same functionally as the browser Family Safety feature including: Activity 
reports, search filtering, and web filtering. Besides toggling the feature, we also provide an 
API to add desired sites to the allowed uris, so app functionality will not be impacted by 
Family Safety. Additionally, parents can also override a block.
Please see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/family-safety for details on Family Safety. 

# Examples
## WinRT and .NET   
```c#
void CreateEnvrionmentWithOption()
{
    // If parents set filtering rules to only allowed sites. App developers can use
    // FamilySafetyAllowedUris to show app content and still honor general filter settings set
    // by parents.
    CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions options = new CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions();
    options.IsFamilySafetyEnabled = true;
    // appassets.example is used as an example app content. All subdomain are added to the allow list
    options.FamilySafetyAllowedUris.Add("https://appassets.example/*");
    auto environment = await CoreWebView2Environment.CreateAsync(BrowserExecutableFolder, UserDataFolder, options);
}
```
## Win32 C++
```cpp
HRESULT InitializeWebView()
{
    // If parents set filtering rules to only allowed sites. App developers can use
    // FamilySafetyAllowedUris to show app content and still honor general filter settings set
    // by parents.
    auto options = Microsoft::WRL::Make<CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions>();
    options->put_IsFamilySafetyEnabled(TRUE);
    // appassets.example is used as an example app content. All subdomain are added to the allow list
    const WCHAR* allowedUris[1] = {L"https://appassets.example/*"};
    options->SetFamilySafetyAllowedUris(1, allowedUris);
    HRESULT hr = CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions("", nullptr, options.Get(),
    Callback<ICoreWebView2CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentCompletedHandler>(
        this, &AppWindow::OnCreateEnvironmentCompleted)
        .Get());
}
```

  ///
  /// The `uris` parameter value are list of uris that is a wildcard string matched aganist the

  /// `?` matches exactly one character.

  /// | `*` | `https://example.com/a/b/c` | Yes | A single * will match all URIs |
  /// | `https://example.com/*` | `https://exmaple.com/a/b/c` | Yes | Matches everything in example.com |
