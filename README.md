### üêû How to report a bug

1. [Search for existing open bugs](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) to avoid duplicates.
    1. If you find that your bug is already reported, give it a üëç reaction, and add a comment with additional details that may help us investigate.
    1. If the issue is not already reported, [open a new issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/new/choose).
1. Tracked issues will be labeled with the <span class="label" style="background-color: #008800"> tracked </span> label. If you see this label, we are aware of the issue and tracking it on our internal backlog.

### üí° How to request a feature

1. [Search for existing feature request](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22feature+request%22) to avoid duplicates.
    1. If you find a similar feature request, give it a üëç reaction, and provide additional context into how you would use the feature.
    2. If the feature is not already requested, [open a new issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/new/choose).

### What do the labels on the issues mean?

- <span class="label" style="background-color: #008800"> tracked </span> We have acknowledged the issue and are tracking it on our internal backlog. We will consider and investigate them in the near future.
    - For bugs, it means we have reproduced the issue.
    - For feature requests, it means we consider it to be a valid request.
- <span class="label" style="background-color: #B60205"> regression </span> A behavior that used to work in a previous version of WebView2, but no longer works as expected. We will prioritize these issues higher.
- <span class="label" style="background-color: #006B75"> priority-low </span> We have considered this issue and we decided that we will not be able to address them in the near future.
