### üêû How to report a bug

1. [Search for existing open bugs](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) to avoid duplicates.
    1. If you find that your bug is already reported, give it a üëç reaction, and add a comment with additional details that may help us investigate.
    1. If the issue is not already reported, [open a new issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/new/choose).
1. Tracked issues will be labeled with the `tracked` label. If you see this label, we are aware of the issue and tracking it on our internal backlog.

### What do the labels on the issues mean?

- `tracked` We have acknowledged the issue and are tracking it on our internal backlog. We will consider and investigate them in the near future.
    - For bugs, it means we think this is an actual product issue.
    - For feature requests, it means we consider it to be a valid request.
- `regression` A behavior that used to work in a previous version of WebView2, but no longer works as expected. We will prioritize this issue higher.
- `priority-low` We have considered this issue and decided that we will not be able to address it in the near future. Developers are welcomed to provide justifications on this issue for us to revisit the prioritization.
