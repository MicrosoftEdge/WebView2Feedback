# WebView2 Feedback

A place for developers to report feedback or search existing issues for [Microsoft Edge WebView2 control](https://aka.ms/webview). Open an [issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebViewFeedback/issues/new) to submit a feature request or bug report. Any "feature request" or "bug" that has the "tracked" label added means that we are also tracking the issue on our internal backlog.

To get the latest news, API proposals, and SDK Release announcements, please subscribe to the [WebView2Announcements](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Announcements) repo!

Tips or Best Practices from other WebView2 devs use the ["Tips" label](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/labels/Tip%21).
